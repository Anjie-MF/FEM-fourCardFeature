## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

After diving deep into CSS grid for a week, I solidified my understanding. That code snippet not only reinforced my grasp of grid but also gave me a fresh appreciation for the power of flexbox in working with CSS layouts.

I'm continuing to expand my knowledge of JavaScript through Skillcrush. This project marks a significant milestone for me â€“ it's the first time I've implemented JavaScript outside of a step-by-step tutorial, demonstrating my growing confidence and ability to apply concepts independently.ðŸŽ‰

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
 grid-template-areas:
            "col1 mid1 col3"
            "col1 mid2 col3";
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

In my continued development, I aim to solidify my skills by working on personal projects that incorporate CSS Grid. This includes replicating existing interfaces I find aesthetically pleasing or functionally effective, allowing me to translate design concepts into well-structured layouts.

### Useful resources

Getting started with CSS Grid is overwhelming at first. To make the learning process smoother, I've compiled a list of resources that cater to different learning styles:

- [Sarah_Edo CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) -This interactive playground allows you to visualize CSS Grid concepts in real-time, making them more intuitive to grasp. I'd recommend it to anyone who NEEDS the visual to understand the abstract.
- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - Get your hands dirty with CSS Grid! This website offers a playful environment to experiment with different grid layouts and solidify your understanding.
- [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) -This comprehensive guide by CSS-tricks delves deep into the intricacies of CSS Grid, providing a solid foundation for advanced use cases.

Pro Tip:  For a more efficient learning experience, consider starting with the playground or garden to gain a basic understanding, followed by the in-depth guide for a more detailed dive.

- [doggaT] (https://github.com/doggaT/four-card-feature-section/tree/master) - A big thanks to doggaT for their innovative approach to CSS Grid layout using creative names for grid areas.  This technique significantly simplifies managing complex layouts and was a key factor in helping me grasp the power of CSS Grid.This approach simplifies managing complex layouts, making it much easier than relying on numeric positioning. 

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67989212/how-to-set-the-icons-to-the-bottom-of-each-card-that-must-be-present-inside-the)- This resource was helpful in understanding how to manipulate font icons effectively, particularly for positioning them at the bottom of cards using CSS.
